# Uno Infinity Remake
This is my 2nd attempt at making the Uno Infinity game. Instead of making it in python and redesing the game struture to allow it to be made in a easier format instead of the clunky mess of my last attempt.

This game is very early in development no playable version yet

I just wanted to remake this game from a workshop game in Tabletops Simulator.
